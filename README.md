# Automation-Gang-CANDINE-STARTUPS
AutomationGang is a random team on the go website focused on automating the whole economy.

We gather random people in the website by order of entering the room, there are thousand rooms at the same time, every person enters a different room randomly, and there is a definition of a profession and the team is forced to find a solution together and produce a report, a design, a marketing website all at the same time. The team is composed of 8 members. You choose your filiation at the beggining of the site, you can especialize in at least 3 traits. When the game is ended, the report is imprinted in our website. We have 12 thousand careers job descriptions and you need to build a way to automate it away with you Gang.
