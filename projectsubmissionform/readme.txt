In this example, the form data is sent to a server-side script called submit_project.php using an AJAX request. You'll need to create the submit_project.php file to process the form data and store it in a database.

Make sure to update the form action URL (action="submit_project.php") and adjust the server-side processing logic according to your needs. Additionally, consider implementing server-side validation and security measures to protect against malicious submissions and data vulnerabilities.
